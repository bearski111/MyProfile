Looking at your code, I did not see any initial errors.
When I ran it however on my Genymotion emulator, your app 
showed up a jumbled mess. I think these are either due to 
formatting errors, or differences in mobile devices. I ran 
mine via Genymotion on an HP PC, so maybe this has to do with 
some of the problems I am seeing. The contrast of the colors 
on the first page, makes viewing your text very difficult. 
The contrast on the second page is well contrasted however, 
so I recommend applying that to your home page. Looking 
specifically at your code, the font sizes you chose to use were 
rather large. I recommend using any font from 10-15 in order to 
fit all information on the screen. I liked that you used percentages
for text placements, this will aid in making your app more accessible
on a variety of devices. I would also recommend adding an image or logo
to make your code more aesthetically pleasing. Business cards should capture
your attention, and make you want to contact that person. Overall, I think you
are headed down the right track but need  to work on the aesthetics and formatting of the apps.
